1. Why is client diversity important for Ethereum?
  -  a client refers to the software application that is ran on a node that listens and interacts with the Ethereum network to verify data and keep it secure. 
  -  clients exist in many different programming languages and are devoloped and managed by different teams
  -  multiple implentations of clients are important as it makes the network stronger by reducing its dependency on a single code base. By increasing the diversity of      the types of clients, this reduces the chance of a potential single point of failure. This also invites opportunity other programmers who specialize in different      languages to work and interact within the community and ecosystem
