## Blockchain

1. Why is client diversity important for Ethereum?

- a client refers to the software application that is ran on a node that listens and interacts with the Ethereum network to verify data and keep it secure.
- clients exist in many different programming languages and are devoloped and managed by different teams
- multiple implentations of clients are important as it makes the network stronger by reducing its dependency on a single code base. By increasing the diversity of the types of clients, this reduces the chance of a potential single point of failure.
- with mutliple clients built from different code bases this reduces the chance of a bug having effect on the network
  - this creates resilience to attacks on the network. Other clients are unlikely exploitable in the same way as the original client that was attacked.
  - furthermore, this helps prevent finality risk, the risk of having 33% + of nodes with the same client to have a bug and prevent the beacon chain from finalizing and coming to consensus
    - even worse, if a client were to hold two-thirds majority and it catches a bug, this could cause the chain to split and finalize, causing validators to have their stakes frozen on an invalid chain
- This also invites opportunity other programmers who specialize in different languages to work and interact within the community and ecosystem

2. Where is the full Ethereum state held ?

- The Ethereum state is held off chain through a mapping between addresses and account states, likely through a modified Patricia Tree within the various clients
- how the state is held and recorded is unique to the specific client, but will still coincide with the rules of the ethereum protocal
- the account state is made up of four values: the nounce (# of transactions from this account), balance (number of wei), storageRoot ( root of a merkle tree that holds all of the details of the storage of the account, generally only relevent with contracts and not external addresses), and the codeHASH ( the generated byte code of the contract)

3. What is a replay attack ? , which 2 pieces of information can prevent it ?

- a replay attack is when an attacker copies a transaction and sends it to the network twice, causing the debited amount from the transaction to be debited twice
- To prevent these, Ethereum transactions have a nonce (sequence number of transactions on the account), and a unique account transaction hash

4. In a contract, how do we know who called a view function ?

- ethereum does not provide a direct way to see who calls view functions.
- these function calls are read-only and do not modify the state of the blockchain, cost no gas, can be called by anyone, and are exexcuted on all nodes in parellel
- the only way to see who calls these function is by indirectly inpecting the transaction that triddered the view function call and look at the 'msg.sender' and this will show the address of the account that initiated the call. This can be done through a block explorer
