    1. the startPayout event doesnt return any information when triggered 
    2. there should be a require here. This will send a message if the requirements arent met 
    3. With the current structure, the msg.sender can call the function, not be added to the array
       but still increase the overall player amount. 
    4. does not emit anything
    5. function is never called and there are no requirements for being a winner
    6. There is nothing calling this function to check the current balance of the contract. 
       At the current state, this contract wont be called
    7. This function currently pays out the inputed amount to every member of the winners array 
       so long as the iterator doesnt exceed the length. Currently, there was noting adding any winners 
       to this array so it would fail since it is trying to send to a non existant address in an empty array
       If there were addresses in the array, there should be a check/ require statement to ensure that payments
       dont exceed what is available in the function. 
    8. Right now, there is no function for the creator of the contract to withdraw the remaining funds after
       a payout has taken place
